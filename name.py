    # A method (i.e., title) is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work.
    # title() displays each word in titlecase, where each word begins with a capital letter.
