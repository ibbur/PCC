    # Variable rules
    # 1) Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. The can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number
    # 2) Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
    # 3) Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.
    # 4) Variable names should be short but descriptive
    # 5) Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the upper case letter O because they can be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
